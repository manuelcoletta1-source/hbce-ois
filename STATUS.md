# 1. Current State

HBCE-OIS is published as an open technical pre-standard defining a deterministic operational identity layer for autonomous, human and hybrid systems.

The current release includes:

- core specification (HBCE-OIS v0.1)
- normative IPR schema
- compliance requirements
- architecture overview
- EU positioning note
- citation reference

The specification is designed to be replicable and independently implementable.

---

# 2. Implementation Readiness

HBCE-OIS is suitable for:

- experimental node deployment
- research and industrial testing
- AI and robotics integration testing
- append-only identity logging systems
- verification-layer prototyping

No centralized infrastructure is required.

Nodes may operate independently.

# 3. Intended Evaluation Context

HBCE-OIS may be evaluated within:

- robotics environments
- AI agent systems
- autonomous device testing
- industrial automation
- research pilot programs
- distributed verification experiments

---

# 4. Standardization Trajectory (Informative)

Possible future pathways include:

- multi-node interoperability testing
- research and industrial pilots
- academic and technical evaluation
- contribution to future European technical discussions
- voluntary adoption experiments

This repository represents an early-stage open technical pre-standard.

---

# 5. Repository Role

This repository acts as:

- canonical technical draft source
- public specification reference
- interoperability baseline
- experimental implementation reference

---

# Status Declaration

HBCE-OIS v0.1-prestandard is publicly released for technical evaluation and pilot experimentation.

No institutional endorsement implied.
Open for independent implementation and analysis.
