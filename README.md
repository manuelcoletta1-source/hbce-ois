# HBCE-OIS

HBCE-OIS (Hermeticum Blindata Computabile Evolutiva — Operational Identity Standard) is an open European pre-standard defining a deterministic operational identity layer for autonomous, human and hybrid systems.

The standard introduces a cryptographically verifiable Identity Primary Record (IPR), deterministic verification logic, fail-closed execution gating and append-only auditability.

HBCE-OIS is designed to be:
- open and replicable
- interoperable across independent nodes
- hash-only and no-custody by design
- aligned with emerging EU regulatory frameworks

This repository contains the initial technical specification and supporting materials for early-stage implementation and evaluation.

Status: Draft v0.1 (Pre-Standard)
